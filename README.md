# GitHub Painter

Create custom contribution patterns on your GitHub profile with this interactive tool.

## Overview

GitHub Painter allows you to design a custom contribution graph that will appear on your GitHub profile. Simply draw your desired pattern on the interactive calendar grid, and the tool will generate a script that creates the necessary commits to bring your art to life.
